# REScala Manual

The manual serves as an introduction of the concepts in *REScala*.
The full API is covered in the [scaladoc](../scaladoc/rescala/index.html) especially for Signals and Events.
More details can be found in [[7, 3]](#ref).
The manual introduces the concepts related to functional reactive programming and event-based programming from a practical perspective.

* The chapter [The Basics](#the-basics) covers how to get started and integrate *REScala* into a program, and
* The chapter [Common combinators](#common-combinators) presents *REScalas* most common features for composing signals and events.
* The chapter [Combinators](#combinators) describes other combinators of *REScalas*.
* If you encounter any problems, check out the chapter [Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls).
* The readers interested in a more general presentation of these topics can find thee essential references in the section [related work](#related).

## Setup

Create a `build.sbt` file in an empty folder with the following contents:

```scala
scalaVersion := "2.12.6"
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("stg-tud", "maven")
libraryDependencies += "de.tuda.stg" %% "rescala" % "0.24.0"
```

Install [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) and run `sbt console` inside the folder,
this should allow you to follow along the following examples.

The code examples in the manual serve as a self contained Scala REPL session,
all code is executed and results are annotated as comments using [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut).
Most code blocks can be executed on their own when adding this import,
but some require definitions from the prior blocks.
To use all features of *REScala* the only required import is:

```scala
import rescala.default._
```


<!--## Declarative Events-->

<!--*REScala* supports declarative events, which are defined as a-->
<!--composition of other events. For this purpose it offers operators like-->
<!--`e_1 || e_2` , `e_1 && p` , `e_1.map(f)`. Event composition allows to-->
<!--express the application logic in a clear and declarative way. Also,-->
<!--the update logic is better localized because a single expression-->
<!--models all the sources and the transformations that define an event-->
<!--occurrence.-->

<!--Declarative events are defined by composing other events. The-->
<!--following code snippet shows some examples of valid definitions for-->
<!--declarative events.-->

<!--```scala-->
<!--val e1 = Evt[Int]()-->
<!--// e1: rescala.default.Evt[Int] = rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51-->

<!--val e2 = Evt[Int]()-->
<!--// e2: rescala.default.Evt[Int] = rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51-->

<!--val e3 = e1 || e2-->
<!--// e3: rescala.reactives.Event[Int,rescala.parrp.ParRP] = (or rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51 rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51)-->

<!--val e4 = e1 && ((x: Int)=> x>10)-->
<!--// e4: rescala.reactives.Event[Int,rescala.parrp.ParRP] = (filter rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51)-->

<!--val e5 = e1 map ((x: Int)=> x.toString)-->
<!--// e5: rescala.reactives.Event[String,rescala.parrp.ParRP] = e5:17-->
<!--```-->

<!--This section presents in details the operators that allow one to-->
<!--compose events into declarative events.-->


<!--# Imperative Events-->

<!--*REScala* supports different kind of events. Imperative events are-->
<!--directly triggered from the user. Declarative events trigger when the-->
<!--events they depend on trigger. In reactive applications, events are-->
<!--typically used to model changes that happen at discrete points in-->
<!--time. For example a mouse click from the user or the arrival of a new-->
<!--network packet. Some features of *REScala* events are valid for all-->
<!--event types.-->

<!--* Events carry a value. The value is associated to the event when-->
<!--  the event is fired and received by all the registered handlers when-->
<!--  each handler is executed.-->

<!--* Events are generic types parametrized with the type of value-->
<!--  they carry, like `Event[T]` and `Evt[T]` where-->
<!--  `T` is the value carried by the event.-->

<!--* Both imperative events and declarative events are subtypes of-->
<!--  `Event[T]` and can referred to generically.-->

<!--*REScala* imperative events are triggered imperatively by the-->
<!--programmer. One can think to imperative events as a generalization of-->
<!--a method call which supports (multiple) bodies that are registered and-->
<!--unregistered dynamically.-->


## The Basics

<!--Because most code is imperative,-->
<!--you need to know the following imperative parts of *REScala* for starters,-->
<!--before making use of the functional features.-->
This chapter is about using Var and Evt, the imperative subtypes of Signal and Event.

### Var, set, now

A `Var[T]` holds a value of type `T`.
`Var[T]` is a subtype of `Signal[T]`. See also the chapter about Signals.
In contrast to declarative signals, `Var`s can be read and written to.

```scala
val a = Var(0)
val b = Var("Hello World")
val c = Var(List(1,2,3))
val d = Var((x: Int) => x * 2)
```

Vars enable the framework to track changes of input values.
Vars can be changed directly, via set and transform, which will trigger a propagation:

```scala
a.set(10)
println(a.now)
// 10

a.transform( val => val + 1 )
println(a.now)
// 11

c.transform( list => 0 :: list )
println(c.now)
// List(0, 1, 2, 3)
```

<!--Vars are used by the framework to track changes to inputs,-->
<!--the value of a var must not be mutated indirectly,-->
<!--as such changes are hidden to the framework.-->

### Evt, fire

Imperative events are defined by the `Evt[T]` type.
`Evt[T]` are a subtype of `Event[T]`.
The value of the parameter `T` defines the value that is attached to the event.
If you do not care about the value, you can use an `Evt[Unit]`.
If you need more than one value to the same event, you can use tuples.
The following code snippet shows some valid events definitions:

```scala
val e1 = Evt[Int]()
val e2 = Evt[Unit]()
val e3 = Evt[(Boolean, String, Int)]()
```

Events can be fired with the method `fire`, which will start a propagation.

```
e1.fire(5)
e2.fire(())
e3.fire((false, "Hallo", 5))
```

### Now, observe, remove

The current value of a signal can be accessed using the ```now``` method.
It is useful for debugging and testing, and sometimes inside onclick handlers.
If possible, use observers or even better combinators instead.

```scala
println((a.now, s.now, t.now))
// (0, 2, false)
```

The `observe` attaches a handler function to the event.
Every time the event is fired, the handler function is applied to the current value of the event.

```scala
val e = Evt[String]()
val o = e.observe({ x =>
  val string = "hello " + x + "!"
  println(string)
})

e.fire("annette")
// hello annette!

e.fire("tom")
// hello tom!
```

If multiple handlers are registered, all of them are executed when the event is fired.
Applications should not rely on the order of handler execution.

```scala
val e = Evt[Int]()
val o1 = e observe { x => println(x) }
val o2 = e observe { x => println(f"n: $x") }

e.fire(10)
// n: 10
// 10

e.fire(10)
// n: 10
// 10
```

<!--The signature of the handler must conform the signature of the event, since the handler is supposed to process the attached value and perform side effects.-->
<!--For example is the event is of type `Event[(Int,Int)]` the handler must be of type `(Int,Int) => Unit`.-->

<!--```scala-->
<!--val e = Evt[(Int,String)]()-->
<!--// e: rescala.default.Evt[(Int, String)] = rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51-->

<!--e observe (x => {-->
<!--  println(x._1)-->
<!--  println(x._2)-->
<!--})-->
<!--// res15: rescala.reactives.Observe[rescala.parrp.ParRP] = res15:18-->

<!--e observe ((x: (Int,String)) => {-->
<!--  println(x)-->
<!--})-->
<!--// res16: rescala.reactives.Observe[rescala.parrp.ParRP] = res16:18-->
<!--```-->

Note that events without arguments still need an argument in the handler.

```scala
val e = Evt[Unit]()
e observe { x => println("ping") }
e observe { _ => println("pong") }
```

Scala allows one to refer to a method using the partially applied function syntax.
This approach can be used to directly register a method as an event handler.

```scala
def m1(x: Int) = {
  val y = x + 1
  println(y)
}

val e = Evt[Int]
val o1 = e observe m1 _
e.fire(10)
```

Handlers can be unregistered from events with the `remove` operator.
When a handler is unregistered, it is not executed when the event is fired.
If you create handlers, you should also think about removing them, when they are no longer needed.

```scala
val e = Evt[Int]()
val handler1 = e observe println

e.fire(10)
// n: 10
// 10

handler1.remove()
```

### Signal Expressions

Signals are defined by the syntax ```Signal{```*sigexpr*```}```, where *sigexpr* is a side effect-free expression.
A signal that carries integer values has the type ```Signal[Int]```.

Inside a signal expression other signals should be accessed with the ```()``` operator.
In the following code, the signal `c` is defined to be `a + b`.
When `a` or `b` are updated, the value of `c` is updated as well.

```scala
val a = Var(2)
val b = Var(3)
val c = Signal { a() + b() }
println((a.now, b.now, c.now))
// (2,3,5)

a set 4
println((a.now, b.now, c.now))
// (4,3,7)

b set 5
println((a.now, b.now, c.now))
// (4,5,9)
```

The signal ```c``` is a dependent / derivative of the vars ```a``` and ```b```, meaning that the values of ```s``` depends on both ```a``` and ```b```.

Here are some more example of using signal expressions:

```scala
val a = Var(0)
val b = Var(2)
val c = Var(true)
val s = Signal{ if (c()) a() else b() }

def factorial(n: Int) = Range.inclusive(1,n).fold(1)(_ * _)

val a = Var(0)
val s: Signal[Int] = Signal {
  val tmp = a() * 2
  val k = factorial(tmp)
  k + 2
}
```


### Example

Now, we have introduced enough features of *REScala* to give a simple example.
The following example computes the displacement `space` of a particle that is moving at constant speed `SPEED`.
The application prints all the values associated to the displacement over time.

```scala
val SPEED = 10
val time = Var(0)
val space = Signal{ SPEED * time() }
val o1 = space observe ((x: Int) => println(x))
// 0

while (time.now < 5) {
  Thread sleep 20
  time set time.now + 1
}
// 10
// 20
// 30
// 40
// 50

o1.remove()
```

The application behaves as follows.
Every 20 milliseconds, the value of the `time` var is increased by 1 (Line 9).
When the value of the `time` var changes,
the signal expression at Line 3 is reevaluated and the value of `space` is updated.
Finally, the current value of the `space` signal is printed every time the value of the signal changes.

Note that using `println(space.now)` would also print the value of the signal, but only at the point in time in which the print statement is executed.
Instead, the approach described so far prints *all* values of the signal.

<!--More details about converting signals into events and back are provided in [Conversion Functions](#conversion-functions).-->


## Common Combinators

Combinators express functional dependencies among values.
Intuitively, the value of a combinator is computed from one or multiple input values.
Whenever any inputs changes, the value of the combinator is also updated.

### Latest, Changed

Conversion between signals and events are fundamental to introduce
time-changing values into OO applications -- which are usually event-based.

This section covers the basic conversions between signals and events.
Figure 1 shows how basic conversion functions can bridge signals and events.
Events (Figure 1, left) occur at discrete point in time (x axis) and
have an associate value (y axis).
Signals, instead, hold a value for a continuous interval of time (Figure 1, right).
The `latest` conversion functions creates a signal from an event.
The signal holds the value associated to an event.
The value is hold until the event is fired again and a new value is available.
The `changed` conversion function creates an event from a signal.
The function fires a new event every time a signal changes its value.

<figure markdown="1">
![Event-Signal](./event-signal.png)
<figcaption>Figure 1: Basic conversion functions.
</figcaption>
</figure>

The `latest` function applies to a event and returns and a signal
holding the latest value of the event `e`.
The initial value of the signal is set to `init`.

`latest[T](e: Event[T], init: T): Signal[T]`

Example:

```scala
val e = Evt[Int]()
val s: Signal[Int] = e.latest(10)
assert(s.now == 10)

e.fire(1)
assert(s.now == 1)

e.fire(2)
assert(s.now == 2)

e.fire(1)
assert(s.now == 1)
```

The `changed` function applies to a signal and returns an event
that is fired every time the signal changes its value.

`changed[U >: T]: Event[U]`

Example:

```scala
var test = 0
val v =  Var(1)
val s = Signal{ v() + 1 }
val e: Event[Int] = s.changed
val o1 = e observe ((x:Int)=>{test+=1})

v.set(2)
assert(test == 1)

v.set(3)
assert(test == 2)
```


### Map

The reactive `r.map f` is obtained by applying `f` to the value carried by `r`.
The map function must take the parameter as a formal parameter.
The return type of the map function is the type parameter value of the resulting event.
If `r` is a signal, then `r map f` is also a signal.
If `r` is an event, then `r map f` is also an event.

```scala
val s = Var[Int](0)
val s_MAP: Signal[String] = s map ((x: Int) => x.toString)
val o1 = s_MAP observe ((x: String) => println(s"Here: $x"))

s set 5
// Here: 5

s set 15
// Here: 15

val e = Evt[Int]()
val e_MAP: Event[String] = e map ((x: Int) => x.toString)
val o1 = e_MAP observe ((x: String) => println(s"Here: $x"))

e.fire(5)
// Here: 5

e.fire(15)
// Here: 15
```


### Fold

The `fold` function creates a signal by folding events with a
given function. Initially the signal holds the `init`
value. Every time a new event arrives, the function `f` is
applied to the previous value of the signal and to the value
associated to the event. The result is the new value of the signal.

`fold[T,A](e: Event[T], init: A)(f :(A,T)=>A): Signal[A]`

Example:

```scala
val e = Evt[Int]()
val f = (x:Int,y:Int)=>(x+y)
val s: Signal[Int] = e.fold(10)(f)

e.fire(1)
e.fire(2)
assert(s.now == 13)
```


### Or, And

The event `e_1 || e_2` is fired upon the occurrence of one among `e_1`
or `e_2`. Note that the events that appear in the event expression
must have the same parameter type (`Int` in the next example).
The or combinator is left-biased, so if both e_1 and e_2 fire in the same
transaction, the left value is returned.

```scala
val e1 = Evt[Int]()
val e2 = Evt[Int]()
val e1_OR_e2 = e1 || e2
val o1 = e1_OR_e2 observe ((x: Int) => println(x))

e1.fire(1)
// 1

e2.fire(2)
// 2
```

The event `e && p` (or the alternative syntax `e filter p`) is fired if `e` occurs and the predicate `p` is satisfied.
The predicate is a function that accepts the event parameter as a formal parameter and returns `Boolean`.
In other words the filter operator filters the events according to their parameter and a predicate.

```scala
val e = Evt[Int]()
val e_AND: Event[Int] = e filter ((x: Int) => x>10)
val o1 = e_AND observe ((x: Int) => println(x))

e.fire(5)

e.fire(3)

e.fire(15)
// 15

e.fire(1)

e.fire(2)

e.fire(11)
// 11
```


{::comment}
### dropParam

The `dropParam` operator transforms an event into an event with
`Unit` parameter. In the following example the `dropParam`
operator transforms an `Event[Int]` into an `Event[Unit]`.

```scala
val e = Evt[Int]()
val e_drop: Event[Unit] = e.dropParam
val o1 = e_drop observe (_ => println("*"))

e.fire(10)
// *

e.fire(10)
// *
```

The typical use case for the `dropParam` operator is to make events
with different types compatible. For example the following snippet is
rejected by the compiler since it attempts to combine two events of
different types with the `||` operator.

```scala
scala> /* WRONG - DON'T DO THIS */
     | val e1 = Evt[Int]()
e1: rescala.default.Evt[Int] = rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51

scala> val e2 = Evt[Unit]()
e2: rescala.default.Evt[Unit] = rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51

scala> val e1_OR_e2 = e1 || e2  // Compiler error
<console>:17: warning: a type was inferred to be `AnyVal`; this may indicate a programming error.
       val e1_OR_e2 = e1 || e2  // Compiler error
                         ^
e1_OR_e2: rescala.reactives.Event[AnyVal,rescala.parrp.ParRP] = (or rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51 rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51)
```

The following example is correct. The `dropParam` operator allows
one to make the events compatible with each other.

```scala
val e1 = Evt[Int]()
// e1: rescala.default.Evt[Int] = rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51

val e2 = Evt[Unit]()
// e2: rescala.default.Evt[Unit] = rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51

val e1_OR_e2: Event[Unit] = e1.dropParam || e2
// e1_OR_e2: rescala.default.Event[Unit] = (or e1_OR_e2:17 rescala.interface.RescalaInterfaceRequireSerializer#Evt:51)
```

## Combinators


### Count Signal

Returns a signal that counts the occurrences of the event.
Initially, when the event has never been fired yet, the signal holds the value 0.
The argument of the event is simply discarded.

`count(e: Event[_]): Signal[Int]`

```scala
val e = Evt[Int]()
val s: Signal[Int] = e.count

assert(s.now == 0)

e.fire(1)

e.fire(3)

assert(s.now == 2)
```


### Last(n) Signal

The `last` function generalizes the `latest` function and
returns a signal which holds the last `n` events.

`last[T](e: Event[T], n: Int): Signal[List[T]]`

Initially, an empty list is returned. Then the values are
progressively filled up to the size specified by the
programmer. Example:

```scala
val e = Evt[Int]()
val s: Signal[scala.collection.LinearSeq[Int]] = e.last(5)
val o1 = s observe println
// Queue()

e.fire(1)
// Queue(1)

e.fire(2)
// Queue(1, 2)

e.fire(3);e.fire(4);e.fire(5)
// Queue(1, 2, 3)
// Queue(1, 2, 3, 4)
// Queue(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

e.fire(6)
// Queue(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

### List Signal

Collects the event values in a (growing) list. This function should be
used carefully. Since the entire history of events is maintained, the
function can potentially introduce a memory overflow.

`list[T](e: Event[T]): Signal[List[T]]`


### LatestOption Signal

The `latestOption` function is a variant of the `latest`
function which uses the `Option` type to distinguish the case in
which the event did not fire yet. Holds the latest value of an event
as `Some(val)` or `None`.

`latestOption[T](e: Event[T]): Signal[Option[T]]`

Example:

```scala
val e = Evt[Int]()
val s: Signal[Option[Int]] = e.latestOption()

assert(s.now == None)

e.fire(1)
assert(s.now == Option(1))

e.fire(2)
assert(s.now == Option(2))

e.fire(1)
assert(s.now == Option(1))
```


### Fold matcher Signal

The `fold` `Match` construct allows to match on one of multiple events.
For every firing event, the corresponding handler function is executed,
to compute the new state.
If multiple events fire at the same time,
the handlers are executed in order.
The acc parameter reflects the current state.


```scala
val word = Evt[String]
val count = Evt[Int]
val reset = Evt[Unit]
val result = Events.foldAll(""){ acc => Events.Match(
  reset >> (_ => ""),
  word >> identity,
  count >> (acc * _),
)}

val o1 = result.observe(r => println(r))
//

count.fire(10)

reset.fire()

word.fire("hello")
// hello

count.fire(2)
// hellohello

word.fire("world")
// world

update(count -> 2, word -> "do them all!", reset -> (()))
// do them all!do them all!
```

### Iterate Signal

Returns a signal holding the value computed by `f` on the
occurrence of an event. Differently from `fold`, there is no
carried value, i.e. the value of the signal does not depend on the
current value but only on the accumulated value.

`iterate[A](e: Event[_], init: A)(f: A=>A): Signal[A]`

Example:

```scala
var test: Int = 0
val e = Evt[Int]()
val f = (x:Int)=>{test=x; x+1}
val s: Signal[Int] = e.iterate(10)(f)

e.fire(1)
assert(test == 10)
assert(s.now == 11)

e.fire(2)
assert(test == 11)
assert(s.now == 12)

e.fire(1)
assert(test == 12)
assert(s.now == 13)
```


### Change Event

The ```change``` function is similar to ```changed```, but it
provides both the old and the new value of the signal in a tuple.

```change[U >: T]: Event[(U, U)]```

Example:

```scala
val s = Var(5)
val e = s.change
val o1 = e observe println

s.set(10)
// Diff(Value(5), Value(10))

s.set(20)
// Diff(Value(10), Value(20))
```


### ChangedTo Event

The ```changedTo``` function is similar to ```changed```, but it
fires an event only when the signal changes its value to a given
value.

```changedTo[V](value: V): Event[Unit]```

```scala
var test = 0
val v =  Var(1)
val s = Signal{ v() + 1 }
val e: Event[Unit] = s.changedTo(3)
val o1 = e observe ((x:Unit)=>{test+=1})

assert(test == 0)

v set(2)
assert(test == 1)

v set(3)
assert(test == 1)
```


### Flatten

The ```flatten``` function is used to ``flatten'' nested reactives.

It can, for instance, be used to detect if any signal within a collection of signals
fired a changed event:

```scala
val v1 = Var(1)
val v2 = Var("Test")
val v3 = Var(true)
val collection: List[Signal[_]] = List(v1, v2, v3)
val innerChanges = Signal {collection.map(_.changed).reduce((a, b) => a || b)}
val anyChanged = innerChanges.flatten
val o1 = anyChanged observe println
// res105: rescala.reactives.Observe[rescala.parrp.ParRP] = res105:17

v1.set(10)
// 10

v2.set("Changed")
// Changed

v3.set(false)
// false
```

## Testing

Conventional testing methods fail to thoroughly test reactive applications.
Nodes may never be exposed to the full range of their possible inputs based on their current location in the spanned dependency graph.
Furthermore, on receiving an invalid input, it is impossible to trace back the route of the problem.
To tackle those shortcomings `rescala.extra.invarariant.SimpleScheduler` inside the `Tests-Sources` subproject adds the concept of _invariants_ and _generators_ to Rescala.

### Invariants

Invariants can be directly attached to `Vars` and `Signals` to define functions that shall be true after every change.
Each node can have multiple invariants and they can be attached using `specify`.

```scala
val v = Var { 42 }

v.specify(
  Invariant { value => value > 0 },
  Invariant { value => value < 100 }
)
```

Invariants can be named, to make them more expressive.

```scala
v.specify(
  new Invariant("always_positive", { value => value > 0} )
)
```

If an invariant fails an `InvariantViolationException` will be thrown.
The exception message will contain further information about the exception:

```log
rescala.extra.invariant.InvariantViolationException:

Value(-1) violates invariant always_positive in reactive tests.rescala.property.InvariantsTest#sut:95

The error was caused by these update chains:

  tests.rescala.property.InvariantsTest#sut:95 with value: Value(-1)
  â†“
  tests.rescala.property.InvariantsTest#v:94 with value: Value(-100)
```

### Generators

Generators allow to test a `Signal`s whole input range.
For this purpose generators are attached to one or more predecessors of the node to be tested using `setValueGenerator`.
Please check the [Scalacheck UserGuide](https://github.com/typelevel/scalacheck/blob/master/doc/UserGuide.md#generators) for more information on how to create generators.

Calling `test` on a signal will traverse the dependencies of c and find the closest generator on each branch and then use property based testing to find inputs that violate an invariant.

```scala
val a = Var(42)
val b = Var(42)
val c = Signal { a() + b() }

a.setValueGenerator(Arbitrary.arbitrary[Int])
b.setValueGenerator(Arbitrary.arbitrary[PosInt])

c.specify(/* invariants for c */)

c.test()
```

## Common Pitfalls

In this section we
collect the most common pitfalls for users that are new to reactive
programming and *REScala*.


### Accessing values in signal expressions

The ```()```
operator used on a signal or a var, inside a signal expression,
returns the signal/var value *and* creates a dependency. The
```now``` operator returns the current value but does *not*
create a dependency. For example the following signal declaration
creates a dependency between ```a``` and ```s```, and a dependency
between ```b``` and ```s```.

```scala
val s = Signal{ a() + b() }
```

The following code instead establishes only a dependency between
```b``` and ```s```.

```scala
val s = Signal{ a.now + b() }
// <console>:17: warning: Using `now` inside a reactive expression does not create a dependency, and can result in glitches. Use `apply` instead.
//        val s = Signal{ a.now + b() }
//                          ^
// s: rescala.default.Signal[Int] = s:17
```

In other words, in the last example, if ```a``` is updated, ```s```
is not automatically updated. With the exception of the rare cases in
which this behavior is desirable, using ```now``` inside a signal
expression is almost certainly a mistake. As a rule of dumb, signals
and vars appear in signal expressions with the ```()``` operator.


### Attempting to assign a signal

Signals are not assignable.
Signal depends on other signals and vars, the dependency is expressed by the signal expression.
The value of the signal is automatically updated when one of the values it depends on changes.
Any attempt to set the value of a signal manually is a mistake.


### Side effects in signal expressions

Signal expressions should be pure. i.e. they should not modify external variables.
For example the following code is conceptually wrong because the variable
```c``` is imperatively assigned form inside the signal expression (Line 4).

```scala
var c = 0                 /* WRONG - DON'T DO IT */
// c: Int = 0

val s = Signal{
  val sum = a() + b();
  c = sum * 2
}
// s: rescala.default.Signal[Unit] = s:18

// â€¦
println(c)
// 4
```

A possible solution is to refactor the code above to a more functional
style. For example, by removing the variable ```c``` and replacing it
directly with the signal.

```scala
val c = Signal{
  val sum = a() + b();
  sum * 2
}
// c: rescala.default.Signal[Int] = c:17

// â€¦
println(c.now)
// 4
```


### Cyclic dependencies

When a signal ```s``` is defined, a dependency is establishes with each of the
signals or vars that appear in the signal expression of ```s```.
Cyclic dependencies produce a runtime error and must be avoided.
For example the following code:

```scala
val a = Var(0)             /* WRONG - DON'T DO IT */
// a: rescala.default.Var[Int] = a:15

val s = Signal{ a() + t() }
// <console>:17: error: overloaded method value + with alternatives:
//   (x: Double)Double <and>
//   (x: Float)Float <and>
//   (x: Long)Long <and>
//   (x: Int)Int <and>
//   (x: Char)Int <and>
//   (x: Short)Int <and>
//   (x: Byte)Int <and>
//   (x: String)String
//  cannot be applied to (Boolean)
//        val s = Signal{ a() + t() }
//                            ^

val t = Signal{ a() + s() + 1 }
// <console>:17: error: overloaded method value + with alternatives:
//   (x: Double)Double <and>
//   (x: Float)Float <and>
//   (x: Long)Long <and>
//   (x: Int)Int <and>
//   (x: Char)Int <and>
//   (x: Short)Int <and>
//   (x: Byte)Int <and>
//   (x: String)String
//  cannot be applied to (Unit)
//        val t = Signal{ a() + s() + 1 }
//                            ^
```

creates a mutual dependency between ```s``` and
```t```. Similarly, indirect cyclic dependencies must be avoided.


### Objects and mutability

Vars and signals may behave
unexpectedly with mutable objects. Consider the following example.

```scala
/* WRONG - DON'T DO THIS */
class Foo(init: Int) {
  var x = init
}
val foo = new Foo(1)
val varFoo = Var(foo)
val s = Signal{ varFoo().x + 10 }

println(s.now)
// 11

foo.x = 2

println(s.now)
// 11
```

One may expect that after increasing the value of ```foo.x``` in
Line 9, the signal expression is evaluated again and updated
to 12. The reason why the application behaves differently is that
signals and vars hold *references* to objects, not the objects
themselves. When the statement in Line 9 is executed, the
value of the ```x``` field changes, but the reference hold by the
```varFoo``` var is the same. For this reason, no change is detected
by the var, the var does not propagate the change to the signal, and
the signal is not reevaluated.

A solution to this problem is to use immutable objects. Since the
objects cannot be modified, the only way to change a filed is to
create an entirely new object and assign it to the var. As a result,
the var is reevaluated.

```scala
class Foo(val x: Int){}
val foo = new Foo(1)
val varFoo = Var(foo)
val s = Signal{ varFoo().x + 10 }

println(s.now)
// 11

varFoo set (new Foo(2))

println(s.now)
// 12
```

Alternatively, one can still use mutable objects but assign again the
var to force the reevaluation. However this style of programming is
confusing for the reader and should be avoided when possible.

```scala
/* WRONG - DON'T DO THIS */
class Foo(init: Int) {
  var x = init
}
val foo = new Foo(1)
val varFoo = Var(foo)
val s = Signal{ varFoo().x + 10 }

println(s.now)
// 11

foo.x = 2

varFoo set foo

println(s.now)
// 11
```


### Functions of reactive values

Functions that operate on
traditional values are not automatically transformed to operate on
signals. For example consider the following functions:

```scala
def increment(x: Int): Int = x + 1
```

The following code does not compile because the compiler expects an
integer, not a var as a parameter of the ```increment``` function. In
addition, since the ```increment``` function returns an integer,
```b``` has type ```Int```, and the call ```b()``` in the signal
expression is also rejected by the compiler.

```scala
val a = Var(1)           /* WRONG - DON'T DO IT */
// a: rescala.default.Var[Int] = a:15

val b = increment(a)
// <console>:17: error: type mismatch;
//  found   : rescala.default.Var[Int]
//     (which expands to)  rescala.reactives.Var[Int,rescala.parrp.ParRP]
//  required: Int
//        val b = increment(a)
//                          ^

val s = Signal{ b() + 1 }
// s: rescala.default.Signal[Int] = s:16
```

The following code snippet is syntactically correct, but the signal
has a constant value 2 and is not updated when the var changes.

```scala
val a = Var(1)
val b: Int = increment(a.now) // b is not reactive!
val s = Signal{ b + 1 } // s is a constant signal with value 2
```

The following solution is syntactically correct and the signal
```s``` is updated every time the var ```a``` is updated.

```scala
val a = Var(1)
val s = Signal{ increment(a()) + 1 }
```
